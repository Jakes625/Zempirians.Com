/application

Welcome to the core that makes our application tick... This is where
you should spend most of your time tinkering.


->/controllers {
	Each controller action should be stored here.
	}
->/layouts {
	This is where we keep our layouts for the skin of our application.
	}
->/models {
	I haven't the slightest clue... But leave it...
	}
->/views {
	.->/filters: Use for filtering.
	.->/helpers: Use for `OOP` throughout the scripts. [see below]
	.->/scripts: Use for the dynamic STDOUT while using the application.
	}
